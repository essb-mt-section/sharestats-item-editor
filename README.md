from Windows defender, because the executable is not a registered Windows 
application.

you from installing.

* PySimpleGUI
* appdirs

Optional requirement:
* rpy2 >=3.4


## Rendering Rmd File (work in progress)

To render Rmd files directly via the *StatsShare-Item-Editor*, you need 
a functioning 
installation of *R* including the *R*-package `exams`. 

If you don't use the Windows executable, install the Python-package `rpy2` (`pip install rpy2`). 

Windows user find two executable files for *StatsShare-Item-Editor*, one with

rendering does not work on computers  without a *R* installation.
